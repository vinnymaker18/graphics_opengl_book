Learning OpenGL programming by working through a few books.

1. [Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with C++](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~gordonvs/textC1E.html)
2. [3D Computer Graphics: A Mathematical Introduction with (Modern) OpenGL](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/MathCG2/)
3. [Learn OpenGL programming](https://learnopengl.com)

### Setup

This is a MacOS specific setup. The requirements are

1. OpenGL 4.1
2. GLFW
3. GLM
4. GLEW

OpenGL is provided by MacOS, while you'll likely need to compile the remaining 3 from sources.
